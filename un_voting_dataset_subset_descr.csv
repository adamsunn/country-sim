31,2023-12-19,"The proposed resolution highlights the ongoing concern within the United Nations regarding the use of mercenaries as a method of violating human rights and obstructing the right of peoples to self-determination. The General Assembly emphasizes its previous resolutions and international agreements, condemning any state involvement or tolerance of mercenary activities aimed at destabilizing governments, particularly in developing countries. The resolution reaffirms the UN Charter's principles, urging states to prevent their territories and nationals from participating in mercenary activities. It acknowledges the work of the Human Rights Council's working group in exploring regulatory frameworks for private military and security companies. States are urged to enact national regulations, ensuring these companies do not infringe on rights within host countries, emphasizing accountability for violations. The resolution calls on states to join the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries and supports continuous investigation and monitoring by the Working Group. Furthermore, it recommends states engage with the working group's initiatives and requests ongoing support from the UN Secretary-General and the High Commissioner for Human Rights to enhance efforts against mercenary-related activities.",Use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination ,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,0.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,2.0,2.0,,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,2.0,,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
